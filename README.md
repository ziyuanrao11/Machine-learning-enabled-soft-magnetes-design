# Machine-learning-enabled-soft-magnetes-design
The lack of strength and damage tolerance can limit the applications of conventional soft magnetic materials (SMMs), 
particularly in mechanically loaded functional devices. Therefore, strengthening and toughening of SMMs is critically 
important. However, conventional strengthening concepts usually significantly deteriorate soft magnetic properties, 
due to Bloch wall interactions with the defects used for hardening. Here we used data-driven methods to overcome this dilemma, 
by developing bulk SMMs with excellent mechanical and attractive soft magnetic properties.
